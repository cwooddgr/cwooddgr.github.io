Anything that can be done with a computer will be done by a computer.
That's my basic thesis for the age we have just eetered into: an age of
artificial intelligence, or more broadly, an age of automatization.

Why "automatization" and not "automation"? Because the latter implies an
augmentation of human effort whiel the former implies a replacement.

Buckle up, buttercup. Here we go.
