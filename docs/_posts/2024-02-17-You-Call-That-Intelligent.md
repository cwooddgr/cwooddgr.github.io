I decided to be clever and use AI (DALL-E) to create a banner image for this site. I wanted to make a
version of the classic "No Irish Need Apply" sign, from which the name of this site is derrived. But
DALL-E is [notoriously bad at generating text](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6781228-how-can-i-generate-text-in-my-image), as you can see in the image it created for me:

![Stupid AI](/assets/nhna-stupid-ai.png)

Which brings up a common criticism of current AI systems: sometimes they just don't work. They
["hallucinate" facts and references](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-are-ai-hallucinations). They [can't get hands right](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/ai-generated-art-hands-fingers-messed-up). They don't really understand what they're doing&mdash;and are therefore stupid and useless. 

While it might be tempting to dismiss these systems' potential because of their current faults, that
would be a huge error. They're getting better at an astonishing rate. Current generative AI systems have fixed
their issues with rendering realistic body parts, [hands and all](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/26/ai-generated-hands-midjourney/).
Oh, and now they can [animate](https://openai.com/sora) them too.

Scoffing at limitations like those illustrated by the above, uh, illustration is hubris. And we know
what that gets us.
